# Connect-and-Rotate-4
A variation on the classic board game Connect 4. In addition to the usual, this version allows players to choose to rotate the board 90 degrees as a move in lieu of placing a piece on the board.

It's a pretty bare-bones text-based CLI which I plan to improve in the future, however, for the time being I am more concerned with perfecting the mechanics of the game rather than its aesthetics.
